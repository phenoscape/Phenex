Phenex - Ontological Annotation of Phenotypic Diversity
------

Phenex is an application for annotating character matrix files with ontology terms. Character states can be annotated using the Entity-Quality syntax for ontologically describing phenotypes. In addition, taxon entries can be annotated with identifiers from a taxonomy ontology. Phenex saves ontology annotations alongside traditional character matrix data using the new [NeXML](http://www.nexml.org) format standard for evolutionary data. 

More information, including documentation of system requirements, installation, and usage, can be found at the [Phenex website](http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Phenex).

History
=======

Phenex has been initially developed as part of the [Phenoscape project](http://phenoscape.org). It was influenced by and builds on Phenote and OBO-Edit from the [OBO project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/).
