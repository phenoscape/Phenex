Phenex - Ontological Annotation of Phenotypic Diversity
------

Phenex is an application for annotating character matrix files with ontology terms. Character states can be annotated using the Entity-Quality syntax for ontologically describing phenotypes. In addition, taxon entries can be annotated with identifiers from a taxonomy ontology. Phenex saves ontology annotations alongside traditional character matrix data using the new [NeXML] format standard for evolutionary data.

More information, including documentation of system requirements, installation, and usage, can be found at the [Phenex website].

History
